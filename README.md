# Mrs. Potluck


Description
------------
Mrs. Potluck is an app designed to facilitate the process of hosting a potluck. The app allows the user, after signing up and logging into the site, to create a shareable potluck event that can be shared with a unique link generated for the event from the backend. Once the event has been created and the link shared, each person invited can add to the list of potluck items, and designate the category of the item they plan to bring by selecting from a select list. Potluck-ing has never been so easy!
